Step 2, in your ReadMe,  create how you want your readMe to be formatted, and then step 3, in the javascript  you will insert the required  files and installations such as the npm inquirer @8.2.4.. As you have all your installations make your function to transfer your data from js to the ReadMe file without having to write down the same repeated questions.
